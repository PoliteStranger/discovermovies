Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008â2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008â2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137302,"_movieId":607,"_personId":2334074,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Dishwasher (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137303,"_movieId":607,"_personId":1219337,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Spouse K (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137304,"_movieId":607,"_personId":56696,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137305,"_movieId":607,"_personId":1215942,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Aliens (voice) (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137306,"_movieId":607,"_personId":1183437,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Police Inspector (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137307,"_movieId":607,"_personId":1178647,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137308,"_movieId":607,"_personId":111875,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137309,"_movieId":607,"_personId":2061467,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Police Officer #4 (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137310,"_movieId":607,"_personId":2565207,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Special Tech (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137311,"_movieId":607,"_personId":5174,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137312,"_movieId":607,"_personId":978698,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137313,"_movieId":607,"_personId":488,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137314,"_movieId":607,"_personId":16483,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (archive footage) (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137315,"_movieId":607,"_personId":160573,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":14343,"_genreId":28,"Genres":null,"_movieId":607},{"genreKey":14344,"_genreId":12,"Genres":null,"_movieId":607},{"genreKey":14345,"_genreId":35,"Genres":null,"_movieId":607},{"genreKey":14346,"_genreId":878,"Genres":null,"_movieId":607}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"1997-07-02T00:00:00","_budget":90000000,"_revenue":589390539,"_popularity":58.265,"_runtime":98},"Score":3.0},{"Movie":{"movieId":616,"_title":"The Last Samurai","_description":"Nathan Algren is an American hired to instruct the Japanese army in the ways of modern warfare, which finds him learning to respect the samurai and the honorable principles that rule them.

He is best known for playing Dominic Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise and is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.\n\nHe began his career in 1990 but struggled to gain roles until he wrote, directed, produced, scored, and starred in the short film Multi-Facial (1995). This attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, who was developing Saving Private Ryan (1998); Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear. He subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999) while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining the Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick film franchises.\n\nDiesel voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and its sequel (2017), as well as Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). Away from action films, he has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised. Diesel portrayed the comic book superhero Bloodshot in its 2020 film adaptation and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.\n\nHe founded the production company One Race Films, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for a number of his star vehicles. Diesel also founded the record label Racetrack Records and video game developer Tigon Studios and has provided his voice and motion capture for all of Tigon's releases.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008â2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008â2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Executive Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341796,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":51588,"Person":null,"_job":"Original Music Composer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341797,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":66899,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341798,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71538,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341799,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71539,"Person":null,"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341800,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":35294,"Person":null,"_job":"Screenplay","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341801,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71540,"Person":null,"_job":"Screenplay","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341802,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71541,"Person":null,"_job":"Screenplay","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341803,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":2917048,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341804,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":2917049,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341805,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":34202,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Anakin Skywalker (voice)"},{"employmentId":341806,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":41345,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Ahsoka Tano (voice)"},{"employmentId":341807,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":19506,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Obi-Wan Kenobi / 4A-7 / Medical Droid (voice)"},{"employmentId":341808,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":23680,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Captain Rex / Commander Cody / Commander Fox / Clone Troopers (voice)"},{"employmentId":341809,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71535,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Narrator / Yoda / Admiral Yularen (voice)"},{"employmentId":341810,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":52698,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Asajj Ventress / Tee-C-Seventy (voice)"},{"employmentId":341811,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":11764,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Chancellor Palpatine / Darth Sidious (voice)"},{"employmentId":341812,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":35219,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Ziro the Hutt / General Loathsom / Kronos-327 (voice)"},{"employmentId":341813,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":283842,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"PadmÃ© Amidala (voice)"},{"employmentId":341814,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71536,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"General Grievous / Battle Droids (voice)"},{"employmentId":341815,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":24362,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Jabba the Hutt (voice)"},{"employmentId":341816,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":1235786,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Rotta the Huttlet (voice)"},{"employmentId":341817,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":2231,"Person":{"_personId":2231,"_Personname":"Samuel L.

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005).

(born May 14, 1944) is an American filmmaker and entrepreneur. Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008â2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313558,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":192772,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313559,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":1307069,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313560,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":108,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313561,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":1034253,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313562,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":1021364,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self (archive footage)"},{"employmentId":313563,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":1307071,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313564,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":1307072,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313565,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":15344,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313566,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":12891,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313567,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":1307073,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313568,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":207800,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313569,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":19303,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313570,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":1307075,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313571,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":58769,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313572,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":95778,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313573,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":1307076,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313574,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":1307077,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313575,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":185736,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313576,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":120576,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self (archive footage)"},{"employmentId":313577,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":984100,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313578,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":19011,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self (archive footage)"},{"employmentId":313579,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":10279,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self (archive footage)"},{"employmentId":313580,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":1222410,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313581,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":173426,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313582,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":117180,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Self"},{"employmentId":313583,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":35172,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Narrator"},{"employmentId":313584,"_movieId":128295,"_personId":935512,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":33440,"_genreId":99,"Genres":null,"_movieId":128295}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"2007-05-28T00:00:00","_budget":0,"_revenue":0,"_popularity":7.542,"_runtime":91},"Score":3.0},{"Movie":{"movieId":171118,"_title":"Watch the Skies!: Science Fiction, the 1950s and Us","_description":"Directors Stephen Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron discuss the science fiction movies of the 1950s that influenced them.","_posterUrl":"/4eFRoHcQqGCrxOOWgAEGU8UH668.jpg","_employmentList":[{"employmentId":257810,"_movieId":171118,"_personId":44950,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":257811,"_movieId":171118,"_personId":44950,"Person":null,"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":257812,"_movieId":171118,"_personId":44952,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":257813,"_movieId":171118,"_personId":1763687,"Person":null,"_job":"Original Music Composer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":257814,"_movieId":171118,"_personId":2,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Narrator (voice)"},{"employmentId":257815,"_movieId":171118,"_personId":488,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":257816,"_movieId":171118,"_personId":1,"Person":{"_personId":1,"_Personname":"George Lucas","_Personpopularity":7.66,"_biography":"George Walton Lucas Jr. (born May 14, 1944) is an American filmmaker and entrepreneur.

Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008â2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Executive Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316027,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":19801,"Person":{"_personId":19801,"_Personname":"Rick McCallum","_Personpopularity":1.032,"_biography":"","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/4no2HrRZXX7kiAXEmiTKEzLKAJM.jpg","_dob":"1954-08-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316028,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":876,"Person":null,"_job":"Screenplay","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316029,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":968,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316030,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":3079,"Person":null,"_job":"Director of Photography","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316031,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":4760,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316032,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":5330,"Person":null,"_job":"Production Design","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316033,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":16425,"Person":null,"_job":"Director of Photography","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316034,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":23651,"Person":null,"_job":"Production Design","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316035,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":40151,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316036,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":51697,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316037,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":52025,"Person":null,"_job":"Original Music Composer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316038,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":134114,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316039,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":158858,"Person":null,"_job":"Screenplay","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316040,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":2037650,"Person":null,"_job":"Costume Design","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316041,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":94968,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Henry Jones, Jr."},{"employmentId":316042,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":250,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Miss Helen Seymour"},{"employmentId":316043,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":214991,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Anna Jones"},{"employmentId":316044,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":172935,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Professor Henry Jones, Sr."},{"employmentId":316045,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":8937,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Charles Leadbeater"},{"employmentId":316046,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":38998,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Annie Besant"},{"employmentId":316047,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":1223812,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Li"},{"employmentId":316048,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":1411986,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Ah Pin"},{"employmentId":316049,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":1635772,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Krishnamurti"},{"employmentId":316050,"_movieId":222042,"_personId":1225863,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Hubert Van Hook"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":33668,"_genreId":28,"Genres":null,"_movieId":222042},{"genreKey":33669,"_genreId":12,"Genres":null,"_movieId":222042},{"genreKey":33670,"_genreId":18,"Genres":null,"_movieId":222042},{"genreKey":33671,"_genreId":10751,"Genres":null,"_movieId":222042},{"genreKey":33672,"_genreId":10770,"Genres":null,"_movieId":222042}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"2007-10-23T00:00:00","_budget":0,"_revenue":0,"_popularity":2.195,"_runtime":95},"Score":5.0},{"Movie":{"movieId":222046,"_title":"The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones: Spring Break Adventure","_description":"The sixth film in the series.","_posterUrl":"/fzEfU6nJPBWU1dtVuTYQRTSIhTl.jpg","_employmentList":[{"employmentId":33179,"_movieId":222046,"_personId":1,"Person":{"_personId":1,"_Personname":"George Lucas","_Personpopularity":7.66,"_biography":"George Walton Lucas Jr. (born May 14, 1944) is an American filmmaker and entrepreneur.

Sixteen year old Indiana Jones joins an international trio of spies plotting against their German counterparts in the neutral city of Barcelona. After his old acquaintance Pablo Picasso helps him get a job at Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, Indy devices a plan to forge a love letter written by the German cultural attachÃ© to make it seem he is having an affair with the Countess of Toledo. In August of the same year, Indiana is reassigned to Prague where he is to receive an important phone call. Unfortunately his hotel room proves to be unequipped with a phone. Indy heads for the Ministery of Telephones, where he learns that having to confront Czech bureaucracy can be quite a trial.","_posterUrl":"/iHc4NqIUwQptUpMQUytawfmuqr3.jpg","_employmentList":[{"employmentId":316998,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":1,"Person":{"_personId":1,"_Personname":"George Lucas","_Personpopularity":7.66,"_biography":"George Walton Lucas Jr. (born May 14, 1944) is an American filmmaker and entrepreneur. Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008â2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Executive Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":316999,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":19801,"Person":{"_personId":19801,"_Personname":"Rick McCallum","_Personpopularity":1.032,"_biography":"","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/4no2HrRZXX7kiAXEmiTKEzLKAJM.jpg","_dob":"1954-08-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317000,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":6800,"Person":null,"_job":"Director of Photography","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317001,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":10707,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317002,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":8646,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317003,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":16548,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317004,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":23651,"Person":null,"_job":"Production Design","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317005,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":23319,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317006,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":40151,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317007,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":52025,"Person":null,"_job":"Original Music Composer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317008,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":58034,"Person":null,"_job":"Screenplay","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317009,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":61361,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317010,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":127716,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317011,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":2037650,"Person":null,"_job":"Costume Design","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":317012,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":54789,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Indiana Jones"},{"employmentId":317013,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":41043,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Franz Kafka"},{"employmentId":317014,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":46128,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Nadia"},{"employmentId":317015,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":9191,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Cunningham"},{"employmentId":317016,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":26258,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Colonel Schmidt"},{"employmentId":317017,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":66161,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Julio the Chauffeur"},{"employmentId":317018,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":10707,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Marcello"},{"employmentId":317019,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":663,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Sergei Diaghilev"},{"employmentId":317020,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":7320,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Delfina"},{"employmentId":317021,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":374,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Charles"},{"employmentId":317022,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":100812,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Count of Toledo"},{"employmentId":317023,"_movieId":222057,"_personId":8316,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Anton"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":33763,"_genreId":28,"Genres":null,"_movieId":222057},{"genreKey":33764,"_genreId":12,"Genres":null,"_movieId":222057},{"genreKey":33765,"_genreId":18,"Genres":null,"_movieId":222057},{"genreKey":33766,"_genreId":10770,"Genres":null,"_movieId":222057}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"2007-12-18T00:00:00","_budget":0,"_revenue":0,"_popularity":0.867,"_runtime":90},"Score":6.0},{"Movie":{"movieId":222065,"_title":"The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones: Scandal of 1920","_description":"New York, June 1920.
