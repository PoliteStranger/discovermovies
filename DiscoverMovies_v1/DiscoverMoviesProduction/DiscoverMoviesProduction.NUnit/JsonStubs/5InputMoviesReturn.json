He is the recipient of various accolades, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, in addition to receiving nominations for four Academy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He frequently collaborates with filmmakers Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara, Lars von Trier, Julian Schnabel, and Wes Anderson.\n\nDafoe was an early member of experimental theater company The Wooster Group. He made his film debut in Heaven's Gate (1980), but was fired during production. He had his first leading role in the outlaw biker film The Loveless (1982) and then played the main antagonist in Streets of Fire (1984) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). He received his first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for his role as Sergeant Elias Grodin in Oliver Stone's war film Platoon (1986). In 1988, Dafoe played Jesus in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and costarred in Mississippi Burning, both of which were controversial.\n\nAfter receiving his second Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for portraying Max Schreck in Shadow of the Vampire (2000), Dafoe portrayed the supervillain Norman Osborn / Green Goblin in the superhero film Spider-Man (2002), a role he reprised in its sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) earning him the Guinness World Record for the \"longest career as a live-action Marvel character\". He also portrayed the villains in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005), as well as Carson Clay in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). In 2009, he starred in the experimental film Antichrist, one of his three films with Lars von Trier. Dafoe then appeared in The Fault in Our Stars, John Wick, The Grand Budapest Hotel (all 2014), The Great Wall (2016), Murder on the Orient Express (2017), The Florida Project (2017) (for which he received his third Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category), The Lighthouse (2019), The French Dispatch, and Nightmare Alley (both 2021). He portrayed Nuidis Vulko in the DC Extended Universe films Aquaman (2018), Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2022).\n\nDafoe has portrayed several real-life figures, including T. S. Eliot in Tom & Viv (1994), Pier Paolo Pasolini in Pasolini (2014), Vincent van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate (2018) (for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, his first in that category), and Leonhard Seppala in Togo (2019).","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/ui8e4sgZAwMPi3hzEO53jyBJF9B.jpg","_dob":"1955-07-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Gill

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on

22, 1955) is an American actor. He is the recipient of various accolades, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, in addition to receiving nominations for four Academy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He frequently collaborates with filmmakers Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara, Lars von Trier, Julian Schnabel, and Wes Anderson.\n\nDafoe was an early member of experimental theater company The Wooster Group. He made his film debut in Heaven's Gate (1980), but was fired during production. He had his first leading role in the outlaw biker film The Loveless (1982) and then played the main antagonist in Streets of Fire (1984) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). He received his first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for his role as Sergeant Elias Grodin in Oliver Stone's war film Platoon (1986). In 1988, Dafoe played Jesus in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and costarred in Mississippi Burning, both of which were controversial.\n\nAfter receiving his second Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for portraying Max Schreck in Shadow of the Vampire (2000), Dafoe portrayed the supervillain Norman Osborn / Green Goblin in the superhero film Spider-Man (2002), a role he reprised in its sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) earning him the Guinness World Record for the \"longest career as a live-action Marvel character\". He also portrayed the villains in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005), as well as Carson Clay in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). In 2009, he starred in the experimental film Antichrist, one of his three films with Lars von Trier. Dafoe then appeared in The Fault in Our Stars, John Wick, The Grand Budapest Hotel (all 2014), The Great Wall (2016), Murder on the Orient Express (2017), The Florida Project (2017) (for which he received his third Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category), The Lighthouse (2019), The French Dispatch, and Nightmare Alley (both 2021). He portrayed Nuidis Vulko in the DC Extended Universe films Aquaman (2018), Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2022).\n\nDafoe has portrayed several real-life figures, including T. S. Eliot in Tom & Viv (1994), Pier Paolo Pasolini in Pasolini (2014), Vincent van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate (2018) (for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, his first in that category), and Leonhard Seppala in Togo (2019).","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/ui8e4sgZAwMPi3hzEO53jyBJF9B.jpg","_dob":"1955-07-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Captain John

He is the recipient of various accolades, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, in addition to receiving nominations for four Academy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He frequently collaborates with filmmakers Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara, Lars von Trier, Julian Schnabel, and Wes Anderson.\n\nDafoe was an early member of experimental theater company The Wooster Group. He made his film debut in Heaven's Gate (1980), but was fired during production. He had his first leading role in the outlaw biker film The Loveless (1982) and then played the main antagonist in Streets of Fire (1984) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). He received his first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for his role as Sergeant Elias Grodin in Oliver Stone's war film Platoon (1986). In 1988, Dafoe played Jesus in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and costarred in Mississippi Burning, both of which were controversial.\n\nAfter receiving his second Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for portraying Max Schreck in Shadow of the Vampire (2000), Dafoe portrayed the supervillain Norman Osborn / Green Goblin in the superhero film Spider-Man (2002), a role he reprised in its sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) earning him the Guinness World Record for the \"longest career as a live-action Marvel character\". He also portrayed the villains in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005), as well as Carson Clay in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). In 2009, he starred in the experimental film Antichrist, one of his three films with Lars von Trier. Dafoe then appeared in The Fault in Our Stars, John Wick, The Grand Budapest Hotel (all 2014), The Great Wall (2016), Murder on the Orient Express (2017), The Florida Project (2017) (for which he received his third Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category), The Lighthouse (2019), The French Dispatch, and Nightmare Alley (both 2021). He portrayed Nuidis Vulko in the DC Extended Universe films Aquaman (2018), Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2022).\n\nDafoe has portrayed several real-life figures, including T. S. Eliot in Tom & Viv (1994), Pier Paolo Pasolini in Pasolini (2014), Vincent van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate (2018) (for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, his first in that category), and Leonhard Seppala in Togo (2019).","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/ui8e4sgZAwMPi3hzEO53jyBJF9B.jpg","_dob":"1955-07-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"David Caravaggio"},{"employmentId":189392,"_movieId":409,"_personId":5470,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Katharine Clifton"},{"employmentId":189393,"_movieId":409,"_personId":5471,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Sikh Kip"},{"employmentId":189394,"_movieId":409,"_personId":5472,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Geoffrey Clifton"},{"employmentId":189395,"_movieId":409,"_personId":5473,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Madox"},{"employmentId":189396,"_movieId":409,"_personId":5480,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Mary"},{"employmentId":189397,"_movieId":409,"_personId":920,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Major Muller"},{"employmentId":189398,"_movieId":409,"_personId":5474,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Sgt.

He is the recipient of various accolades, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, in addition to receiving nominations for four Academy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He frequently collaborates with filmmakers Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara, Lars von Trier, Julian Schnabel, and Wes Anderson.\n\nDafoe was an early member of experimental theater company The Wooster Group. He made his film debut in Heaven's Gate (1980), but was fired during production. He had his first leading role in the outlaw biker film The Loveless (1982) and then played the main antagonist in Streets of Fire (1984) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). He received his first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for his role as Sergeant Elias Grodin in Oliver Stone's war film Platoon (1986). In 1988, Dafoe played Jesus in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and costarred in Mississippi Burning, both of which were controversial.\n\nAfter receiving his second Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for portraying Max Schreck in Shadow of the Vampire (2000), Dafoe portrayed the supervillain Norman Osborn / Green Goblin in the superhero film Spider-Man (2002), a role he reprised in its sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) earning him the Guinness World Record for the \"longest career as a live-action Marvel character\". He also portrayed the villains in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005), as well as Carson Clay in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). In 2009, he starred in the experimental film Antichrist, one of his three films with Lars von Trier. Dafoe then appeared in The Fault in Our Stars, John Wick, The Grand Budapest Hotel (all 2014), The Great Wall (2016), Murder on the Orient Express (2017), The Florida Project (2017) (for which he received his third Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category), The Lighthouse (2019), The French Dispatch, and Nightmare Alley (both 2021). He portrayed Nuidis Vulko in the DC Extended Universe films Aquaman (2018), Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2022).\n\nDafoe has portrayed several real-life figures, including T. S. Eliot in Tom & Viv (1994), Pier Paolo Pasolini in Pasolini (2014), Vincent van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate (2018) (for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, his first in that category), and Leonhard Seppala in Togo (2019).","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/ui8e4sgZAwMPi3hzEO53jyBJF9B.jpg","_dob":"1955-07-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Green Goblin / Norman

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137302,"_movieId":607,"_personId":2334074,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Dishwasher (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137303,"_movieId":607,"_personId":1219337,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Spouse K (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137304,"_movieId":607,"_personId":56696,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137305,"_movieId":607,"_personId":1215942,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Aliens (voice) (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137306,"_movieId":607,"_personId":1183437,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Police Inspector (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137307,"_movieId":607,"_personId":1178647,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137308,"_movieId":607,"_personId":111875,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137309,"_movieId":607,"_personId":2061467,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Police Officer #4 (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137310,"_movieId":607,"_personId":2565207,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Special Tech (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137311,"_movieId":607,"_personId":5174,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137312,"_movieId":607,"_personId":978698,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137313,"_movieId":607,"_personId":488,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137314,"_movieId":607,"_personId":16483,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (archive footage) (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":137315,"_movieId":607,"_personId":160573,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Alien on TV Monitor (uncredited)"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":14343,"_genreId":28,"Genres":null,"_movieId":607},{"genreKey":14344,"_genreId":12,"Genres":null,"_movieId":607},{"genreKey":14345,"_genreId":35,"Genres":null,"_movieId":607},{"genreKey":14346,"_genreId":878,"Genres":null,"_movieId":607}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"1997-07-02T00:00:00","_budget":90000000,"_revenue":589390539,"_popularity":58.265,"_runtime":98},{"movieId":616,"_title":"The Last Samurai","_description":"Nathan Algren is an American hired to instruct the Japanese army in the ways of modern warfare, which finds him learning to respect the samurai and the honorable principles that rule them.

He is best known for playing Dominic Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise and is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.\n\nHe began his career in 1990 but struggled to gain roles until he wrote, directed, produced, scored, and starred in the short film Multi-Facial (1995). This attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, who was developing Saving Private Ryan (1998); Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear. He subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999) while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining the Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick film franchises.\n\nDiesel voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and its sequel (2017), as well as Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). Away from action films, he has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised. Diesel portrayed the comic book superhero Bloodshot in its 2020 film adaptation and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.\n\nHe founded the production company One Race Films, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for a number of his star vehicles. Diesel also founded the record label Racetrack Records and video game developer Tigon Studios and has provided his voice and motion capture for all of Tigon's releases.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free

He is the recipient of various accolades, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, in addition to receiving nominations for four Academy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He frequently collaborates with filmmakers Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara, Lars von Trier, Julian Schnabel, and Wes Anderson.\n\nDafoe was an early member of experimental theater company The Wooster Group. He made his film debut in Heaven's Gate (1980), but was fired during production. He had his first leading role in the outlaw biker film The Loveless (1982) and then played the main antagonist in Streets of Fire (1984) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). He received his first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for his role as Sergeant Elias Grodin in Oliver Stone's war film Platoon (1986). In 1988, Dafoe played Jesus in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and costarred in Mississippi Burning, both of which were controversial.\n\nAfter receiving his second Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for portraying Max Schreck in Shadow of the Vampire (2000), Dafoe portrayed the supervillain Norman Osborn / Green Goblin in the superhero film Spider-Man (2002), a role he reprised in its sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) earning him the Guinness World Record for the \"longest career as a live-action Marvel character\". He also portrayed the villains in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005), as well as Carson Clay in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). In 2009, he starred in the experimental film Antichrist, one of his three films with Lars von Trier. Dafoe then appeared in The Fault in Our Stars, John Wick, The Grand Budapest Hotel (all 2014), The Great Wall (2016), Murder on the Orient Express (2017), The Florida Project (2017) (for which he received his third Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category), The Lighthouse (2019), The French Dispatch, and Nightmare Alley (both 2021). He portrayed Nuidis Vulko in the DC Extended Universe films Aquaman (2018), Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2022).\n\nDafoe has portrayed several real-life figures, including T. S. Eliot in Tom & Viv (1994), Pier Paolo Pasolini in Pasolini (2014), Vincent van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate (2018) (for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, his first in that category), and Leonhard Seppala in Togo (2019).","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/ui8e4sgZAwMPi3hzEO53jyBJF9B.jpg","_dob":"1955-07-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Carson

July 22, 1955) is an American actor. He is the recipient of various accolades, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, in addition to receiving nominations for four Academy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He frequently collaborates with filmmakers Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara, Lars von Trier, Julian Schnabel, and Wes Anderson.\n\nDafoe was an early member of experimental theater company The Wooster Group. He made his film debut in Heaven's Gate (1980), but was fired during production. He had his first leading role in the outlaw biker film The Loveless (1982) and then played the main antagonist in Streets of Fire (1984) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). He received his first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for his role as Sergeant Elias Grodin in Oliver Stone's war film Platoon (1986). In 1988, Dafoe played Jesus in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and costarred in Mississippi Burning, both of which were controversial.\n\nAfter receiving his second Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for portraying Max Schreck in Shadow of the Vampire (2000), Dafoe portrayed the supervillain Norman Osborn / Green Goblin in the superhero film Spider-Man (2002), a role he reprised in its sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) earning him the Guinness World Record for the \"longest career as a live-action Marvel character\". He also portrayed the villains in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005), as well as Carson Clay in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). In 2009, he starred in the experimental film Antichrist, one of his three films with Lars von Trier. Dafoe then appeared in The Fault in Our Stars, John Wick, The Grand Budapest Hotel (all 2014), The Great Wall (2016), Murder on the Orient Express (2017), The Florida Project (2017) (for which he received his third Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category), The Lighthouse (2019), The French Dispatch, and Nightmare Alley (both 2021). He portrayed Nuidis Vulko in the DC Extended Universe films Aquaman (2018), Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2022).\n\nDafoe has portrayed several real-life figures, including T. S. Eliot in Tom & Viv (1994), Pier Paolo Pasolini in Pasolini (2014), Vincent van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate (2018) (for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, his first in that category), and Leonhard Seppala in Togo (2019).","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/ui8e4sgZAwMPi3hzEO53jyBJF9B.jpg","_dob":"1955-07-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Detective Donald

He is best known for playing Dominic Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise and is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.\n\nHe began his career in 1990 but struggled to gain roles until he wrote, directed, produced, scored, and starred in the short film Multi-Facial (1995). This attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, who was developing Saving Private Ryan (1998); Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear. He subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999) while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining the Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick film franchises.\n\nDiesel voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and its sequel (2017), as well as Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). Away from action films, he has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised. Diesel portrayed the comic book superhero Bloodshot in its 2020 film adaptation and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.\n\nHe founded the production company One Race Films, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for a number of his star vehicles. Diesel also founded the record label Racetrack Records and video game developer Tigon Studios and has provided his voice and motion capture for all of Tigon's releases.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/9uxTwqB8anAiPomB6Kqm6A73VTV.jpg","_dob":"1967-07-18T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Executive Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297440,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":17767,"Person":null,"_job":"Original Music Composer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297441,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":18184,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297442,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":18185,"Person":null,"_job":"Screenplay","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297443,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":18186,"Person":null,"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297444,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":18187,"Person":null,"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297445,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":18188,"Person":null,"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297446,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":45842,"Person":null,"_job":"Executive Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297447,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":45843,"Person":null,"_job":"Director of Photography","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297448,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":45845,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297449,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":45846,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297450,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":20722,"Person":null,"_job":"Costume Design","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297451,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":1488028,"Person":null,"_job":"Assistant Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":297452,"_movieId":1620,"_personId":18082,"Person":{"_personId":18082,"_Personname":"Timothy Olyphant","_Personpopularity":24.017,"_biography":"Timothy David Olyphant (born May 20, 1968) is an American actor whose notable roles in television drama series include Deadwood as Seth Bullock, Justified as Raylan Givens, and Damages as Wes Krulik.

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on

known professionally as Vin Diesel, is an American actor, producer, director and screenwriter. He is best known for playing Dominic Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise and is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.\n\nHe began his career in 1990 but struggled to gain roles until he wrote, directed, produced, scored, and starred in the short film Multi-Facial (1995). This attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, who was developing Saving Private Ryan (1998); Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear. He subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999) while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining the Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick film franchises.\n\nDiesel voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and its sequel (2017), as well as Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). Away from action films, he has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised. Diesel portrayed the comic book superhero Bloodshot in its 2020 film adaptation and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.\n\nHe founded the production company One Race Films, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for a number of his star vehicles. Diesel also founded the record label Racetrack Records and video game developer Tigon Studios and has provided his voice and motion capture for all of Tigon's releases.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free

He also portrayed the villains in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005), as well as Carson Clay in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). In 2009, he starred in the experimental film Antichrist, one of his three films with Lars von Trier. Dafoe then appeared in The Fault in Our Stars, John Wick, The Grand Budapest Hotel (all 2014), The Great Wall (2016), Murder on the Orient Express (2017), The Florida Project (2017) (for which he received his third Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category), The Lighthouse (2019), The French Dispatch, and Nightmare Alley (both 2021).

(born 18 July 1967), known professionally as Vin Diesel, is an American actor, producer, director and screenwriter. He is best known for playing Dominic Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise and is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.\n\nHe began his career in 1990 but struggled to gain roles until he wrote, directed, produced, scored, and starred in the short film Multi-Facial (1995). This attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, who was developing Saving Private Ryan (1998); Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear. He subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999) while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining the Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick film franchises.\n\nDiesel voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and its sequel (2017), as well as Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). Away from action films, he has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised. Diesel portrayed the comic book superhero Bloodshot in its 2020 film adaptation and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.\n\nHe founded the production company One Race Films, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for a number of his star vehicles. Diesel also founded the record label Racetrack Records and video game developer Tigon Studios and has provided his voice and motion capture for all of Tigon's releases.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/9uxTwqB8anAiPomB6Kqm6A73VTV.jpg","_dob":"1967-07-18T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Toorop"},{"employmentId":345898,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":1620,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Schwester Rebecca"},{"employmentId":345899,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":59373,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Aurora"},{"employmentId":345900,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":2192,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Darquandier"},{"employmentId":345901,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":44079,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Hohepriesterin"},{"employmentId":345902,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":16927,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Gorsky"},{"employmentId":345903,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":2983,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Finn"},{"employmentId":345904,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":47825,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Killa"},{"employmentId":345905,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":25677,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Dr. Newton"},{"employmentId":345906,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":72270,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Jamal"},{"employmentId":345907,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":59374,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Karl"},{"employmentId":345908,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":62439,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Kid with Tattoos"},{"employmentId":345909,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":25726,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Fight Promoter"},{"employmentId":345910,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":132069,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Assistant to High Priestess"},{"employmentId":345911,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":1237646,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Neolite Researcher"},{"employmentId":345912,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":1513403,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Neolite Executive"},{"employmentId":345913,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":1674911,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Neolite Marketing Executive"},{"employmentId":345914,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":1674913,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Neolite MIB"},{"employmentId":345915,"_movieId":9381,"_personId":25732,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Submarine Captain"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":37126,"_genreId":28,"Genres":null,"_movieId":9381},{"genreKey":37127,"_genreId":12,"Genres":null,"_movieId":9381},{"genreKey":37128,"_genreId":878,"Genres":null,"_movieId":9381},{"genreKey":37129,"_genreId":53,"Genres":null,"_movieId":9381}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"2008-08-20T00:00:00","_budget":70000000,"_revenue":72108608,"_popularity":14.94,"_runtime":101},{"movieId":9430,"_title":"Go","_description":"Grocery store clerk Simon occasionally sells drugs from his cash register at work, so when soap opera actors Adam and Zack come looking for Ecstasy on a quiet Christmas Eve, they are surprised to find Ronna covering his shift.

1967), known professionally as Vin Diesel, is an American actor, producer, director and screenwriter. He is best known for playing Dominic Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise and is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.\n\nHe began his career in 1990 but struggled to gain roles until he wrote, directed, produced, scored, and starred in the short film Multi-Facial (1995). This attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, who was developing Saving Private Ryan (1998); Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear. He subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999) while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining the Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick film franchises.\n\nDiesel voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and its sequel (2017), as well as Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). Away from action films, he has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised. Diesel portrayed the comic book superhero Bloodshot in its 2020 film adaptation and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.\n\nHe founded the production company One Race Films, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for a number of his star vehicles. Diesel also founded the record label Racetrack Records and video game developer Tigon Studios and has provided his voice and motion capture for all of Tigon's releases.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/9uxTwqB8anAiPomB6Kqm6A73VTV.jpg","_dob":"1967-07-18T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Dominic Toretto (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":264882,"_movieId":9615,"_personId":1586675,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Model (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":264883,"_movieId":9615,"_personId":201914,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Bully (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":264884,"_movieId":9615,"_personId":226738,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Tea Hair (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":264885,"_movieId":9615,"_personId":3522725,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Auto Shop Bully #2"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":27964,"_genreId":28,"Genres":null,"_movieId":9615},{"genreKey":27965,"_genreId":80,"Genres":null,"_movieId":9615},{"genreKey":27966,"_genreId":18,"Genres":null,"_movieId":9615},{"genreKey":27967,"_genreId":53,"Genres":null,"_movieId":9615}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"2006-06-03T00:00:00","_budget":85000000,"_revenue":158468292,"_popularity":13.951,"_runtime":104},{"movieId":9631,"_title":"The Negotiator","_description":"The police try to arrest expert hostage negotiator Danny Roman, who insists he's being framed for his partner's murder in what he believes is an elaborate conspiracy.

He is best known for playing Dominic Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise and is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.\n\nHe began his career in 1990 but struggled to gain roles until he wrote, directed, produced, scored, and starred in the short film Multi-Facial (1995). This attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, who was developing Saving Private Ryan (1998); Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear. He subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999) while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining the Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick film franchises.\n\nDiesel voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and its sequel (2017), as well as Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018). Away from action films, he has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised. Diesel portrayed the comic book superhero Bloodshot in its 2020 film adaptation and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.\n\nHe founded the production company One Race Films, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for a number of his star vehicles. Diesel also founded the record label Racetrack Records and video game developer Tigon Studios and has provided his voice and motion capture for all of Tigon's releases.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/9uxTwqB8anAiPomB6Kqm6A73VTV.jpg","_dob":"1967-07-18T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Dominic Toretto"},{"employmentId":46789,"_movieId":9799,"_personId":17647,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Letty Ortiz"},{"employmentId":46790,"_movieId":9799,"_personId":22123,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Mia Toretto"},{"employmentId":46791,"_movieId":9799,"_personId":10883,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Johnny Tran"},{"employmentId":46792,"_movieId":9799,"_personId":9186,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Jesse"},{"employmentId":46793,"_movieId":9799,"_personId":12796,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Leon"},{"employmentId":46794,"_movieId":9799,"_personId":31841,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Vince"},{"employmentId":46795,"_movieId":9799,"_personId":15854,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Sgt.

(born 18 July 1967), known professionally as Vin Diesel, is an American actor, producer, director and screenwriter. He is best known for playing Dominic Toretto in the Fast & Furious franchise and is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time.\n\nHe began his career in 1990 but struggled to gain roles until he wrote, directed, produced, scored, and starred in the short film Multi-Facial (1995). This attracted the attention of Steven Spielberg, who was developing Saving Private Ryan (1998); Spielberg re-wrote elements of the film to allow Diesel to appear. He subsequently voiced the titular character in The Iron Giant (1999) while gaining a reputation as an action star after headlining the Fast & Furious, XXX, and The Chronicles of Riddick film franchises.\n\nDiesel voiced Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and its sequel (2017), as well as Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018).

Away from action films, he has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised. Diesel portrayed the comic book superhero Bloodshot in its 2020 film adaptation and is slated to appear in the Avatar sequels.\n\nHe founded the production company One Race Films, where he has also served as a producer or executive producer for a number of his star vehicles.

He is the recipient of various accolades, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, in addition to receiving nominations for four Academy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He frequently collaborates with filmmakers Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara, Lars von Trier, Julian Schnabel, and Wes Anderson.\n\nDafoe was an early member of experimental theater company The Wooster Group. He made his film debut in Heaven's Gate (1980), but was fired during production. He had his first leading role in the outlaw biker film The Loveless (1982) and then played the main antagonist in Streets of Fire (1984) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). He received his first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for his role as Sergeant Elias Grodin in Oliver Stone's war film Platoon (1986). In 1988, Dafoe played Jesus in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and costarred in Mississippi Burning, both of which were controversial.\n\nAfter receiving his second Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for portraying Max Schreck in Shadow of the Vampire (2000), Dafoe portrayed the supervillain Norman Osborn / Green Goblin in the superhero film Spider-Man (2002), a role he reprised in its sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) earning him the Guinness World Record for the \"longest career as a live-action Marvel character\". He also portrayed the villains in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005), as well as Carson Clay in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). In 2009, he starred in the experimental film Antichrist, one of his three films with Lars von Trier. Dafoe then appeared in The Fault in Our Stars, John Wick, The Grand Budapest Hotel (all 2014), The Great Wall (2016), Murder on the Orient Express (2017), The Florida Project (2017) (for which he received his third Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category), The Lighthouse (2019), The French Dispatch, and Nightmare Alley (both 2021). He portrayed Nuidis Vulko in the DC Extended Universe films Aquaman (2018), Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2022).\n\nDafoe has portrayed several real-life figures, including T. S. Eliot in Tom & Viv (1994), Pier Paolo Pasolini in Pasolini (2014), Vincent van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate (2018) (for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, his first in that category), and Leonhard Seppala in Togo (2019).","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/ui8e4sgZAwMPi3hzEO53jyBJF9B.jpg","_dob":"1955-07-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Max Schreck"},{"employmentId":9125,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":1646,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Albin Grau"},{"employmentId":9126,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":2130,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Fritz Arno Wagner"},{"employmentId":9127,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":2462,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Greta Schröder"},{"employmentId":9128,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":1926,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Gustav von Wangenhein"},{"employmentId":9129,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":1222737,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Henrik Galeen"},{"employmentId":9130,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":554271,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Paul"},{"employmentId":9131,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":20523,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Wolfgang Müller"},{"employmentId":9132,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":554272,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Elke"},{"employmentId":9133,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":554273,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Maria"},{"employmentId":9134,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":554274,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Innkeeper"},{"employmentId":9135,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":554275,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Innkeeper's Wife"},{"employmentId":9136,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":549499,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Reporter 1"},{"employmentId":9137,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":18956,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Reporter 2"},{"employmentId":9138,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":1663296,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Drunken Woman"},{"employmentId":9139,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":1439662,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Old Woman"},{"employmentId":9140,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":45054,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Murnau's Crew"},{"employmentId":9141,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":14593,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Micheline (uncredited)"},{"employmentId":9142,"_movieId":10873,"_personId":31438,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Murnau's Crew (uncredited)"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":959,"_genreId":18,"Genres":null,"_movieId":10873},{"genreKey":960,"_genreId":27,"Genres":null,"_movieId":10873}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"2000-05-15T00:00:00","_budget":8000000,"_revenue":8279017,"_popularity":11.374,"_runtime":92},{"movieId":10985,"_title":"The New Guy","_description":"Nerdy high school senior Dizzy Harrison has finally gotten lucky -- after purposely getting expelled, he takes lessons in 'badass cool' from a convict and enrolls at a new school.

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Executive Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341796,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":51588,"Person":null,"_job":"Original Music Composer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341797,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":66899,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341798,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71538,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341799,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71539,"Person":null,"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341800,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":35294,"Person":null,"_job":"Screenplay","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341801,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71540,"Person":null,"_job":"Screenplay","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341802,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71541,"Person":null,"_job":"Screenplay","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341803,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":2917048,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341804,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":2917049,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":341805,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":34202,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Anakin Skywalker (voice)"},{"employmentId":341806,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":41345,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Ahsoka Tano (voice)"},{"employmentId":341807,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":19506,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Obi-Wan Kenobi / 4A-7 / Medical Droid (voice)"},{"employmentId":341808,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":23680,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Captain Rex / Commander Cody / Commander Fox / Clone Troopers (voice)"},{"employmentId":341809,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71535,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Narrator / Yoda / Admiral Yularen (voice)"},{"employmentId":341810,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":52698,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Asajj Ventress / Tee-C-Seventy (voice)"},{"employmentId":341811,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":11764,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Chancellor Palpatine / Darth Sidious (voice)"},{"employmentId":341812,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":35219,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Ziro the Hutt / General Loathsom / Kronos-327 (voice)"},{"employmentId":341813,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":283842,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Padmé Amidala (voice)"},{"employmentId":341814,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":71536,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"General Grievous / Battle Droids (voice)"},{"employmentId":341815,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":24362,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Jabba the Hutt (voice)"},{"employmentId":341816,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":1235786,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Rotta the Huttlet (voice)"},{"employmentId":341817,"_movieId":12180,"_personId":2231,"Person":{"_personId":2231,"_Personname":"Samuel L.

Away from action films, he has enjoyed commercial success in a number of other genres, such as the comedy film The Pacifier (2005), while his performance in Find Me Guilty (2006) was praised.

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":309444,"_movieId":15302,"_personId":12898,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":309445,"_movieId":15302,"_personId":7904,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":309446,"_movieId":15302,"_personId":2417791,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":309447,"_movieId":15302,"_personId":109255,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":309448,"_movieId":15302,"_personId":7885,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":309449,"_movieId":15302,"_personId":63646,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":309450,"_movieId":15302,"_personId":143786,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":33048,"_genreId":99,"Genres":null,"_movieId":15302}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"2007-08-28T00:00:00","_budget":0,"_revenue":0,"_popularity":10.836,"_runtime":87},{"movieId":15450,"_title":"The Family That Preys","_description":"Alice Pratt, a hard working Christian woman, raised her two daughters while managing a simple diner of her own.

He is the recipient of various accolades, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, in addition to receiving nominations for four Academy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He frequently collaborates with filmmakers Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara, Lars von Trier, Julian Schnabel, and Wes Anderson.\n\nDafoe was an early member of experimental theater company The Wooster Group. He made his film debut in Heaven's Gate (1980), but was fired during production. He had his first leading role in the outlaw biker film The Loveless (1982) and then played the main antagonist in Streets of Fire (1984) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). He received his first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for his role as Sergeant Elias Grodin in Oliver Stone's war film Platoon (1986). In 1988, Dafoe played Jesus in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and costarred in Mississippi Burning, both of which were controversial.\n\nAfter receiving his second Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for portraying Max Schreck in Shadow of the Vampire (2000), Dafoe portrayed the supervillain Norman Osborn / Green Goblin in the superhero film Spider-Man (2002), a role he reprised in its sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) earning him the Guinness World Record for the \"longest career as a live-action Marvel character\". He also portrayed the villains in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005), as well as Carson Clay in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). In 2009, he starred in the experimental film Antichrist, one of his three films with Lars von Trier. Dafoe then appeared in The Fault in Our Stars, John Wick, The Grand Budapest Hotel (all 2014), The Great Wall (2016), Murder on the Orient Express (2017), The Florida Project (2017) (for which he received his third Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category), The Lighthouse (2019), The French Dispatch, and Nightmare Alley (both 2021). He portrayed Nuidis Vulko in the DC Extended Universe films Aquaman (2018), Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2022).\n\nDafoe has portrayed several real-life figures, including T. S. Eliot in Tom & Viv (1994), Pier Paolo Pasolini in Pasolini (2014), Vincent van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate (2018) (for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, his first in that category), and Leonhard Seppala in Togo (2019).","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/ui8e4sgZAwMPi3hzEO53jyBJF9B.jpg","_dob":"1955-07-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Paul Smecker

He is the recipient of various accolades, including the Volpi Cup for Best Actor, in addition to receiving nominations for four Academy Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award. He frequently collaborates with filmmakers Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara, Lars von Trier, Julian Schnabel, and Wes Anderson.\n\nDafoe was an early member of experimental theater company The Wooster Group. He made his film debut in Heaven's Gate (1980), but was fired during production. He had his first leading role in the outlaw biker film The Loveless (1982) and then played the main antagonist in Streets of Fire (1984) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). He received his first Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for his role as Sergeant Elias Grodin in Oliver Stone's war film Platoon (1986). In 1988, Dafoe played Jesus in Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ and costarred in Mississippi Burning, both of which were controversial.\n\nAfter receiving his second Academy Award nomination (as Best Supporting Actor) for portraying Max Schreck in Shadow of the Vampire (2000), Dafoe portrayed the supervillain Norman Osborn / Green Goblin in the superhero film Spider-Man (2002), a role he reprised in its sequels Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) earning him the Guinness World Record for the \"longest career as a live-action Marvel character\". He also portrayed the villains in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003) and XXX: State of the Union (2005), as well as Carson Clay in the film Mr. Bean's Holiday (2007). In 2009, he starred in the experimental film Antichrist, one of his three films with Lars von Trier. Dafoe then appeared in The Fault in Our Stars, John Wick, The Grand Budapest Hotel (all 2014), The Great Wall (2016), Murder on the Orient Express (2017), The Florida Project (2017) (for which he received his third Academy Award nomination in the Best Supporting Actor category), The Lighthouse (2019), The French Dispatch, and Nightmare Alley (both 2021). He portrayed Nuidis Vulko in the DC Extended Universe films Aquaman (2018), Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2022).\n\nDafoe has portrayed several real-life figures, including T. S. Eliot in Tom & Viv (1994), Pier Paolo Pasolini in Pasolini (2014), Vincent van Gogh in At Eternity's Gate (2018) (for which he received an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, his first in that category), and Leonhard Seppala in Togo (2019).","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/ui8e4sgZAwMPi3hzEO53jyBJF9B.jpg","_dob":"1955-07-22T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Feeney"},{"employmentId":409055,"_movieId":33996,"_personId":10430,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Ronald

is an American filmmaker and entrepreneur. Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself (voice)"},{"employmentId":325815,"_movieId":42979,"_personId":56890,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Orientation Instructor (voice)"},{"employmentId":325816,"_movieId":42979,"_personId":52139,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Emperor Palpatine (voice)"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":34662,"_genreId":16,"Genres":null,"_movieId":42979},{"genreKey":34663,"_genreId":35,"Genres":null,"_movieId":42979},{"genreKey":34664,"_genreId":878,"Genres":null,"_movieId":42979}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"2007-07-17T00:00:00","_budget":0,"_revenue":0,"_popularity":11.582,"_runtime":23},{"movieId":43566,"_title":"Before and After","_description":"Two parents deal with the effects when their son is accused of murdering his girlfriend.","_posterUrl":"/oK8UKDrjFS14OFoihaQPfmmMOyI.jpg","_employmentList":[{"employmentId":179175,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":117,"Person":null,"_job":"Original Music Composer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179176,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":2866,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179177,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":4504,"Person":null,"_job":"Executive Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179178,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":5493,"Person":null,"_job":"Costume Design","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179179,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":18311,"Person":null,"_job":"Executive Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179180,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":21379,"Person":null,"_job":"Production Design","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179181,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":23393,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179182,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":23393,"Person":null,"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179183,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":35141,"Person":null,"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179184,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":39038,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179185,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":49069,"Person":null,"_job":"Director of Photography","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":179186,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":5064,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Dr. Carolyn Ryan"},{"employmentId":179187,"_movieId":43566,"_personId":3896,"Person":{"_personId":3896,"_Personname":"Liam Neeson","_Personpopularity":22.394,"_biography":"An Irish actor who has been nominated for an Oscar, a BAFTA and three Golden Globe Awards.

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005).

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233707,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":17244,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself/Anakin Skywalker"},{"employmentId":233708,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":3061,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself/Obi-Wan Kenobi"},{"employmentId":233709,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":491,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233710,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":670,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233711,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":1445426,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233712,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":1401796,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233713,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":6800,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233714,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":10123,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233715,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":23651,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233716,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":33193,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Herself"},{"employmentId":233717,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":33195,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233718,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":23454,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233719,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":7790,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":233720,"_movieId":72513,"_personId":68994,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":24530,"_genreId":99,"Genres":null,"_movieId":72513}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"2005-11-01T00:00:00","_budget":0,"_revenue":0,"_popularity":2.284,"_runtime":78},{"movieId":76180,"_title":"Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy","_description":"From the earliest versions of the script to the blockbuster debuts, explore the creation of the Star Wars Trilogy.","_posterUrl":"/xq0MPT1lLxfznTRaAbInxWT2wfh.jpg","_employmentList":[{"employmentId":211951,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":6868,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":211952,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":6868,"Person":null,"_job":"Executive Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":211953,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":223804,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":211954,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":931201,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":211955,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":1308941,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":211956,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":1308941,"Person":null,"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":211957,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":1979324,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":211958,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":2921870,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":211959,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":35172,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Narrator"},{"employmentId":211960,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":130,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself - 'R2-D2'"},{"employmentId":211961,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":948389,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself - Production Supervisor"},{"employmentId":211962,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":108649,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself - Professor and Cultural Historian"},{"employmentId":211963,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":670,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself - Sound Designer"},{"employmentId":211964,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":83786,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Himself"},{"employmentId":211965,"_movieId":76180,"_personId":1,"Person":{"_personId":1,"_Personname":"George Lucas","_Personpopularity":7.66,"_biography":"George Walton Lucas Jr. (born May 14, 1944) is an American filmmaker and entrepreneur.

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas's next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008–2014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history's most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","_gender":2,"_imageUrl":"/WCSZzWdtPmdRxH9LUCVi2JPCSJ.jpg","_dob":"1944-05-14T00:00:00","_dod":"0001-01-01T00:00:00"},"_job":"Executive Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32163,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":5330,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32164,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":6800,"Person":null,"_job":"Director of Photography","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32165,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":10723,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32166,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":23651,"Person":null,"_job":"Production Design","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32167,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":21440,"Person":null,"_job":"Director","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32168,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":23319,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32169,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":40151,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32170,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":51697,"Person":null,"_job":"Editor","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32171,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":61361,"Person":null,"_job":"Art Direction","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32172,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":1131782,"Person":null,"_job":"Producer","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32173,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":2037650,"Person":null,"_job":"Costume Design","_character":"N/A"},{"employmentId":32174,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":54789,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Indiana Jones"},{"employmentId":32175,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":210705,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Molly"},{"employmentId":32176,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":87957,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Colonel Waters"},{"employmentId":32177,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":22109,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Stefan"},{"employmentId":32178,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":4789,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"General Targo"},{"employmentId":32179,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":1925050,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Vasily"},{"employmentId":32180,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":1419427,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Monty"},{"employmentId":32181,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":200365,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Nicholas Hunyadi"},{"employmentId":32182,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":72310,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Dr. Heinzer"},{"employmentId":32183,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":96993,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Paretti"},{"employmentId":32184,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":1529474,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Stanfill"},{"employmentId":32185,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":1896887,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"The Major"},{"employmentId":32186,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":113910,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Agent Picard"},{"employmentId":32187,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":189377,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Tarot Reader"},{"employmentId":32188,"_movieId":417775,"_personId":101949,"Person":null,"_job":"Acting","_character":"Agent Thompson"}],"_genreList":[{"genreKey":3414,"_genreId":10770,"Genres":null,"_movieId":417775},{"genreKey":3415,"_genreId":12,"Genres":null,"_movieId":417775},{"genreKey":3416,"_genreId":27,"Genres":null,"_movieId":417775},{"genreKey":3417,"_genreId":28,"Genres":null,"_movieId":417775}],"_prodCompanyList":[],"_releaseDate":"1999-11-28T00:00:00","_budget":0,"_revenue":0,"_popularity":2.255,"_runtime":92},{"movieId":471208,"_title":"Cannes: All Access","_description":"From its simple beginnings in 1939 in a sleepy beach town in the south of France, the prestigious Cannes Film Festival has become the must-attend red carpet event of the year.
