He attended Pattison College in Binley Road, Coventry, and studied at LAMDA (the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art). His first appearance on the screen was in a small role in This Year's Love (1999), but it was Sparkhouse (2002) (TV) that gave him a break-through role as the charming but a bit odd character of John Standring opposite Sarah Smart. After two guest-roles in \"Cold Feet\" (1997) in 2003 and \"Between the Sheets\" (2003), he landed a role as Steven in Frozen (2005/I), which eventually led him to play the lead role in the big hit BBC drama \"North &amp; South\" (2004). Other than appearing on screen, he has also appeared on stage--in, for example, Macbeth and Hamlet.","birthday":"1971-08-22","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":"http://www.richardarmitageonline.com/","id":30315,"imdb_id":"nm0035514","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Armitage","place_of_birth":"Leicester, England, UK","popularity":16.967,"profile_path":"/lRWWodfrOd5SaLnFrz7UryFhasI.jpg"}
