It's also starting to take away the makeup part. The time is right, I am 64 years old, and the business is crazy right now. I like to do things right, and they wanted cheap and fast. That is not what I want to do, so I just decided it is basically time to get out. I would consider designing and consulting on something, but I don't think I will have a huge working studio anymore.\"","birthday":"1950-12-08","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":16178,"imdb_id":"nm0000711","known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Rick Baker","place_of_birth":"Binghamton, New York, USA","popularity":1.589,"profile_path":"/8thqXBS5CQF0U2zsHAVM9GH7i4I.jpg"}
