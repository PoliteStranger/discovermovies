{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Marc Lawrence (born 22 October 1959) is a Jewish American screenwriter, film producer and film director.\n\nIn 1981, he graduated from Binghamton University with a degree in English and later served as a staff writer, and then supervising producer, on NBC's Family Ties. Lawrence has written films such as The Out-of-Towners (1999), Miss Congeniality (2000), and Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous (2005). He has both written and directed Two Weeks Notice (2002), Music and Lyrics (2007), and most recently, Did You Hear About the Morgans? (2009), all starring Hugh Grant. A good way of getting an insight into Marc Lawrence's iterative approach to screenwriting and production is to play the relevant \"extras\" on the DVDs of some of the aforementioned movies. These commentaries demonstrate interesting insights into the productive nature of the interaction between actors, producers, director and screenwriter, and Mr Lawrence is quick to commend the impromptu, unscripted contributions of others. Donald Petrie's commentary on \"Miss Congeniality\" commends Mr Lawrence more highly than he commends himself in the thoroughly entertaining commentary he made with Sandra Bullock for the same film.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Marc Lawrence (filmmaker), licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.â€‹","birthday":"1959-10-22","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":18323,"imdb_id":"nm0492909","known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marc Lawrence","place_of_birth":"Brooklyn, New York, USA","popularity":3.074,"profile_path":null}
