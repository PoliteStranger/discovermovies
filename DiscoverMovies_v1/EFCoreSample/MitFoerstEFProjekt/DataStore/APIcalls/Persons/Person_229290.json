Alexander worked on many films about Ninjas, such as Wu Tang vs. Ninja (1987), The Super Ninja (1984), Shaolin vs. Ninja (1983), Ninja Condors (1987), and Mafia vs. Ninja (1985). He also worked on Shaolin films such as Shaolin Chastity Kung Fu (1981) and the famous Shaolin vs. Lama (1983). In 1984, Tai directed Lou in a nine-hour epic titled Ninja: The Final Duel (1986), and some time after this epic film, Alexander quit acting but did not stop making movies. He continued a long partnership with Robert Tai, only this time as an action choreographer, working on such films as Fist of Legends 2: Iron Bodyguards (1996). He often collaborated with his good friend, the African-American kick-boxer Eugene Thomas (Trammell), where they either fought together as a black/Asian duo, or faced up against each other as arch enemies.","birthday":null,"deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":229290,"imdb_id":"nm0521585","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alexander Lo Rei","place_of_birth":"Taiwan","popularity":2.674,"profile_path":"/uw5FOT1NnlXpgIrlz93kEXUgzcg.jpg"}
