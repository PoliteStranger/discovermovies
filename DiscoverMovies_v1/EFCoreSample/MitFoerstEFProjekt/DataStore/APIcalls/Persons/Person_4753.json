Bloom had an early interest in acting, including appearing in several commercials as a child, but made his big break in the Sergio Leone film Once Upon a Time in America. From there, he was offered the role of Dusty Donovan in the hit soap opera As the World Turns, which he played for several years. During that run, Bloom became the youngest winner of a Daytime Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Young Leading Man during the 12th Daytime Emmy Awards show for his performance on the series. Despite his success, he soon grew tired of the scheduling involved in that field and eventually left the series to star in several television movies and myriad guest appearances.","birthday":"1970-06-30","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":4753,"imdb_id":"nm0089141","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Bloom","place_of_birth":"Long Island - New York - USA","popularity":6.968,"profile_path":"/9mZKhI3aVbzZ5Xq43n7fGzWAqi0.jpg"}
