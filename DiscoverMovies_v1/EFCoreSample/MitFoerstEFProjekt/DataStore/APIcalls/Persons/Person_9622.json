{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nEric Brevig (born 1957) is a film director and visual effects supervisor known for his work in several major theatrical films and television shows. He was Visual Effects Supervisor and Second Unit Director on the 2001 Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay action drama Pearl Harbor.\n\nSince his film school days at UCLA Brevig had been fascinated with the potential of 3D for live-action movie production, and he learned everything he could about it. During the production of 1986's Captain EO short for the Disney theme parks he was substantially responsible for supervising the technical aspects of the 3D photography. After several second unit director's assignments in special effects-heavy films like Men in Black and Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, Brevig's previous 3D experience and expertise turned out to be the factor that helped him get his first full-blown director's job when he was offered the chance to direct the 2008 film Journey to the Center of the Earth 3-D (a New Line Cinema release), the first narrative feature shot entirely in digital 3-D. He next directed Yogi Bear, another 3-D movie, for Warner Bros., and he is attached to direct a 3-D Korean War drama, 17 Days of Winter, about the 1950 Battle of Chosin Reservoir. 17 Days of Winter, expected to cost $80–100 million, is scheduled to shoot in Korea and New Zealand over the winter of 2010-2011 for 2012 release.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Eric Brevig, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":null,"deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":9622,"imdb_id":"nm0108094","known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Eric Brevig","place_of_birth":null,"popularity":3.594,"profile_path":null}
