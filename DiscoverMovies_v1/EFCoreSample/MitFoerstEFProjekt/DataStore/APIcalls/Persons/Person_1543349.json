{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Kent Hovind"],"biography":"Kent Hovind became a Christian at age sixteen and immediately desired to serve Christ with his life. His keen interest in math and science throughout his high school career prompted his enrollment at Illinois Central College as a science major. After two years of undergraduate work there, and feeling God calling him to full-time Christian service, he completed his bachelor of religious education degree at Midwestern Baptist College of Pontiac, Michigan in 1974.  For fifteen years Hovind taught high school math and science, during which time he completed his master’s degree in education. While researching and writing his doctoral dissertation on the subject of creation vs. evolution, he saw the tremendous need for exposing evolution as a dangerous, religious worldview, and for arming Christians with scientific evidence that there are no contradictions between true science and the Bible. In response to these needs, shortly after finishing his Ph.D. in religious education, he began a full-time ministry of presenting the foundational truth of creation and the utter fallacy of evolution with a mission of strengthening the faith of believers and winning the lost to Christ. His award-winning seven-part Creation Seminar continues to travel around the globe with translations in thirty-two languages.","birthday":null,"deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":1543349,"imdb_id":"nm2379457","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dr. Kent Hovind","place_of_birth":null,"popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null}
