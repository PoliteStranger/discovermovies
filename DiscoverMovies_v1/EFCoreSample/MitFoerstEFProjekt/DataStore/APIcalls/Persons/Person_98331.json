{"adult":true,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Al Goldstein was an actor, producer, publisher, and First-Amendment Rights activist from Brooklyn, New York. Best known as the publisher of Screw magazine, a sleezy porn magazine filled with sex acts and toilet humor, Screw also contained some surprisingly smart, sharp-witted political commentary - though usually expressed in the crudest way possible. Goldstein was also involved in the production of some early NYC-based porn movies in the 1970s and early 80s, and later was among a group fighting in court for First Amendment protections.","birthday":"1936-01-10","deathday":"2013-12-19","gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":98331,"imdb_id":"nm0326155","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Al Goldstein","place_of_birth":"Brooklyn, New York, USA","popularity":0.656,"profile_path":null}
