Edwards played the role of Jimmy Woods, a young gaming prodigy who could master any game he could play even without having ever played it before. Traumatized by the sudden drowning death of his twin sister that also resulted in a divorce, Jimmy (Edwards) and his brother Corey (Savage) go to California, the only word Jimmy utters for a good portion of the movie. In trying to figure out what exactly \"California\" means, they embark on a journey and end up entering a video game tournament. Jimmy wins the competition with the game Super Mario Bros. 3, and on the way back he sees \"California\" - a tourist stop with a dinosaur exhibit that their family stopped into when his twin was still alive.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Luke Edwards, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia","birthday":"1980-03-24","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":33052,"imdb_id":"nm0250180","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luke Edwards","place_of_birth":"Nevada City, California, USA","popularity":8.823,"profile_path":"/cZcUHl6jojQJiviybrDV5iX8K9Z.jpg"}
