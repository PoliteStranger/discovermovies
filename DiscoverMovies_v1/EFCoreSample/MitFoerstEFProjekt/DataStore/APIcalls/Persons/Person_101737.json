Dora’s main influence is the European cinema of the 70s: he is a great admirer of the work of Italian directors Gualtiero Jacopetti, Ruggero Deodato, and Sergio Martino, as well as of composers Riz Ortolani, Pippo Caruso, Ennio Morricone, and Guido & Maurizio De Angelis. Europe’s literary and poetical tradition is another major influence on Dora: many dialogues in his films contain references to the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Eduard Mörike, Georg Büchner, Marquis de Sade, Friedrich Nietzsche, and many others.","birthday":null,"deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":101737,"imdb_id":"nm2112806","known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Marian Dora","place_of_birth":"Germany","popularity":3.001,"profile_path":null}
