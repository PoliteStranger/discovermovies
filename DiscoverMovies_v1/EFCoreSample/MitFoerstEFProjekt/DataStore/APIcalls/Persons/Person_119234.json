Though they were very close to each other, Paul Grimault and Jean-François Laguionie rarely worked together (though Grimault produced Laguionie's first three shorts).\n\nJean-François Laguionie then directed several short films, climaxing with the now famous La Traversée de l'Atlantique à la rame (Rowing across the Atlantic) (1978), which won the César Award for best short animated film in 1979.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","birthday":"1939-10-04","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":119234,"imdb_id":"nm0481451","known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jean-François Laguionie","place_of_birth":"Besançon, France","popularity":1.435,"profile_path":"/y3JdvfCrHjjnG7DfXeDldfPJMSZ.jpg"}
