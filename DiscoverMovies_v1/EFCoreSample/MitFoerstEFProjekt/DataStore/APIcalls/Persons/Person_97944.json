Non-academic acting students in 1967 became automatically eligible for the Selective Service and in the middle of his second year at the Playhouse, Campbell was drafted into the U.S. Army. He retaliated, by joining the Marines. He was wounded in action, and after months of recuperation, he returned to The Playhouse and finished the program. Campbell has worked, on stage, in film and on television ever since.","birthday":"1947-07-22","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":97944,"imdb_id":"nm0132517","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"J.
