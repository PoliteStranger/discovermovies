Kamar's father, a Cuban drummer and percussionist, would see two of his three sons become professional musicians, one a world renowned drummer, the other a world renowned percussionist. Kamar, the youngest of the brood, began playing the trumpet at the age of four and although he played alongside trumpet greats like Harry James, Doc Severinsen, and Dizzy Gillespie, Kamar chose to go another route.
