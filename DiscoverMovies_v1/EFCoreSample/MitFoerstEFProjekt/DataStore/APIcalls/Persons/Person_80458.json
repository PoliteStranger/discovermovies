Shim rose to popularity in the 1990s, starring in some of the highest-rated Korean dramas of all time, such as The Last Match, M and Trap of Youth. But she is best known for her acclaimed performance in Hur Jin-ho's melodrama Christmas in August, for which she swept the Best Actress awards in 1998.
