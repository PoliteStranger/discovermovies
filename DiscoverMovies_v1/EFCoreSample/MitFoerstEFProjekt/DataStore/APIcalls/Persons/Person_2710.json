He moved to the USA in 1971. The son of an engineer, he majored in physics at California State University but, after graduating, drove a truck to support his screen-writing ambition. He landed his first professional film job as art director, miniature-set builder, and process-projection supervisor on Roger Corman's Battle Beyond the Stars (1980) and debuted as a director with Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1981) the following year. In 1984, he wrote and directed The Terminator (1984), a futuristic action-thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn, and Linda Hamilton. It was a huge success. After this came a string of successful science-fiction action films such as Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). Cameron is now one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. He was formerly married to producer Gale Anne Hurd, who produced several of his films. He married Kathryn Bigelow in 1989.","birthday":"1954-08-16","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":2710,"imdb_id":"nm0000116","known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Cameron","place_of_birth":"Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada","popularity":9.846,"profile_path":"/9NAZnTjBQ9WcXAQEzZpKy4vdQto.jpg"}
