His physical prowess and bravery as a stuntman and stunt-double had already brought him some level of repute when he was finally given opportunities to shine playing characters in movies. This revealed an actor with a raw and distinct presence even if he was called upon to play only villainous or supporting roles. He might have become a new Yuen Wah if it hadn’t been for an unfortunate change in H-K action cinema. At the end of the 1990s we saw not only a sharp decline in action filmmaking but also a shift away from performers with genuine skills to being supplanted in action roles by screen-savvy special effects enhanced actors.","birthday":"1962-02-25","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":131732,"imdb_id":"nm0944578","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Xiong Xin-Xin","place_of_birth":"Guangxi, China","popularity":5.184,"profile_path":"/nEk3tdN3Qbrq9yrEQEINo4cqwT6.jpg"}
