An Army brat himself who lived on five different bases as a child, Serpico says of the Frank Sherwood role: \"I didn’t really have to work so hard to prepare for [this role] because it is a part of me; it’s in my blood.\"","birthday":"1964-06-27","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":2257,"imdb_id":"nm0785352","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Terry Serpico","place_of_birth":null,"popularity":10.521,"profile_path":"/nxku2blYCPYtEmAkKlUFJ4YUWsa.jpg"}
