Because of a childhood injury, he was rejected by the United States Army when he tried to enlist during World War II, so he worked as an ambulance driver in England and France. In the late 1940s, he was a chicken farmer operating an egg route in Ridgefield, Connecticut when one of his customers offered him a job in the music library at NBC. The clerical position led to his directing live televised performances by the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Arturo Toscanini. Soon after he was made a stage manager of the network's newly formed opera company, and he later became its Director.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","birthday":"1921-03-28","deathday":"2008-02-10","gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":1238017,"imdb_id":"nm0115185","known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kirk Browning","place_of_birth":" New York City, New York, USA","popularity":1.439,"profile_path":"/sqqMIpAeowuV9dFVYHmgeocOGMr.jpg"}
