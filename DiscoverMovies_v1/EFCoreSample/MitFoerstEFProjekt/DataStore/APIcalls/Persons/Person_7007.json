{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Claudia Ferri was born into a multicultural family in Montreal. Her father of Italian Origins and her mother's ancestry is Irish, Scottish, French and Native American. When all the members of her family got together for festivities, Italian, French, English or Arab was spoken among cousins or aunts and uncles. It's no surprise that she is multilingual (English, Italian, French and Spanish) on screen too.  The eastern coast of U.S.A. is a familiar scene to her, as many of her childhood summers would see the family traveling down to New York State, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, where they would visit cousins and relatives. Later, her parents built a home and took up residence in Naples, Florida. Claudia was in fact visiting her parents in Naples when a phone call from her agent informed her that she was considered to play opposite Aidan Quinn & Donald Sutherland in \"The assignment\", which proved to be her first big break in film.","birthday":null,"deathday":null,"gender":1,"homepage":"http://claudiaferri.com","id":7007,"imdb_id":"nm0274750","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Claudia Ferri","place_of_birth":"Montreal, Quebec, Canada","popularity":5.159,"profile_path":"/mWFY9va5C9w7MRZZzfd0nGk0i1r.jpg"}
