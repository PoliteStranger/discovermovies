{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nAdam Ant (born Stuart Leslie Goddard on 3 November 1954 in Marylebone, London) is an English musician who gained popularity as the lead singer of New Wave/post-punk group Adam and the Ants and later as a solo artist, scoring ten UK top ten hits between 1980 and 1983, including three No.1s. Ant was also a star in America where he not only scored a string of hit singles and albums, but was once voted sexiest man in America by the viewers of MTV. He is also an actor, having appeared in over two dozen films or television episodes between 1985 and 2003.\n\nSince 2010, Ant has undertaken a major reactivation of his musical career, performing live regularly in his hometown London and beyond, recording a new album and with a UK national tour now underway. His present comeback continues and thrives despite concerns about such activities being merely another symptom of the mental health issues which were in considerable part responsible for his lengthy spell of near-inactivity spanning the late 1990s and 2000s.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Adam Ant, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.â€‹","birthday":"1954-11-03","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":45042,"imdb_id":"nm0001914","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Ant","place_of_birth":"Marylebone, London, United Kingdom","popularity":2.39,"profile_path":"/74Y5Gi0wj7084kRjnoWV6ayl1ld.jpg"}
