Muccino was handpicked by Will Smith to serve as the director of The Pursuit of Happyness. Said Muccino in a later interview, \"Will had to defend me as a choice to the studio; I could barely speak English and I could barely express my vision. I felt protected and that I could push my ideas even when they weren't totally conventional. The reason why I found respect, and respect for my ideas, was because of Will.\" Muccino also directed Smith's later film, Seven Pounds.","birthday":"1967-05-20","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":20646,"imdb_id":"nm0610831","known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gabriele Muccino","place_of_birth":"Rome, Italy","popularity":3.208,"profile_path":"/4kj5yc9pDLnvsen3tdTFdFkqKtc.jpg"}
