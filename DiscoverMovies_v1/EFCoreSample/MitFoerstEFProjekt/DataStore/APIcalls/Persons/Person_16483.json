He wrote or co-wrote most of the 16 films in all three franchises, and directed many of the films.\n\nStallone's film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry as well as having its film props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallone's use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps. Philadelphia has a statue of his Rocky character placed permanently near the museum. It was announced on December 7, 2010 that Stallone was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in the non-participant category.\n\nIn 1977, Stallone was nominated for two Academy Awards for Rocky, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. He became the third man in history to receive these two nominations for the same film, after Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles. He received positive reviews, as well as his first Golden Globe Award win and a third Academy Award nomination, for reprising the role of Rocky Balboa in Ryan Coogler's 2015 film Creed.","birthday":"1946-07-06","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":"http://www.sylvesterstallone.com","id":16483,"imdb_id":"nm0000230","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvester Stallone","place_of_birth":"New York City, New York, USA","popularity":43.459,"profile_path":"/qDRGPAcQoW8Wuig9bvoLpHwf1gU.jpg"}
