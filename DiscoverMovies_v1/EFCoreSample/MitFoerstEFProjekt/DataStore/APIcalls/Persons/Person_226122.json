{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["فتحي عبدالوهاب","Fathi Abdulwahhab"],"biography":"Fathi is a bit of a rebel and a dreamer. He has succeeded in securing celebrity status for himself within the short span of a few years despite the fact that he does not place great value on being famous nor on assuming leading roles in performances. His journey as an artist began in his college where he was enrolled in the faculty of commerce. At that point, Fathi used to perform on an amateur level. (This was until a friend of his applied on his behalf for a television production.) Thereafter, Fathi took part in three back-to-back seasons of the television show “Bilarabi Al Faseeh”. Following that stint, Fathi’s career in cinema took off.","birthday":"1971-08-21","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":226122,"imdb_id":"nm1193573","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fathy Abdel Wahab","place_of_birth":null,"popularity":1.554,"profile_path":"/kYIlzvwURNRxrQED5OtkqYCUN8Z.jpg"}
