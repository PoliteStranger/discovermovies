She grew up in the Dutch city of Utrecht, where she attended the MULO Regentesseschool high school. After that, she attended the Artibus Art School in Utrecht, where she specialized in fashion design. In 1975 she moved to Italy.\n\nAfter modelling in various magazines in the Netherlands and Belgium, Gemser began to take part in some soft erotic films. She became internationally recognised after starring in a number of Black Emanuelle films in the 1970s.\n\nHer most mainstream and well-received role was as Laotian refugee Keo Sirisomphone in Michael Landon's 1983 American television movie, Love Is Forever, in which she was credited as Moira Chen.[citation needed] Gemser continued to do films: at times, she worked with her actor husband, Gabriele Tinti. In the 1990s, she left the movies to do costume designing for film. In addition, she lost her husband, who died of cancer in 1991. Today she lives in retirement and low profile in Rome, but she is still remembered as one of the many beautiful women who played the sensual adventuress Emmanuelle.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Laura Gemser, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia","birthday":"1950-10-05","deathday":null,"gender":1,"homepage":null,"id":41127,"imdb_id":"nm0002098","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Gemser","place_of_birth":"Java, Indonesia","popularity":18.688,"profile_path":"/zObMWYEHJkPEhmFsyW8uFCVRgfo.jpg"}
