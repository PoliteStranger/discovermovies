However his early career was in education and child care, first teaching at three Brooklyn public schools & subsequently directing a Chinatown day care center for 6 years.\n\nHis interest in theater did not wane, and opportunity presented itself later when he was invited to join the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre Company. During this time he perfomed in numerous productions, including “Yellow Fever,” where he played the role of Chuck Chan.\n\nMeanwhile, he also was developing experience in film. His first SAG job was in the movie “Eyewitness.\" This led to a number of small roles in other films, until he landed a more significant role in “The Last Dragon” which has since become a cult classic. Roles since then have included General Tan in Martin Scorsese’s “Kundun,” and Sung Yon Kim in the “Sopranos.\"\n\nHenry has a warm personality with a keen sense of humor, which can be subtle and cerebral or antic and physical.
