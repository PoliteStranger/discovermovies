Shortly after graduating from the National Audiovisual School, he made his first short, immediately acclaimed by the local critics. One of these short films, \"Life in Fog\" (1999) is even considered as the most famous short ever made in Iran. This success allowed Bahman Ghobadi to make several feature films, the best known being his first, \"A Time for Drunken Horses\" (2000), the first Kurd film in the history of Iran. This film and all the the others made by Ghobadi were hits in the festival circuit, garnered dozens of awards but were little seen or not seen at all in his native country. His last movie to date, filmed without official permit, rapidly and feverishly, \"No One Knows About Persian Cats\" (2009) is a remarkable semi-documentary about underground indie music in Tehran.","birthday":"1969-02-01","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":54607,"imdb_id":"nm0315842","known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Bahman Ghobadi","place_of_birth":"Baneh, Iran","popularity":1.528,"profile_path":"/ojTbH3EDsFdxvNReAJWSvZy1heS.jpg"}
