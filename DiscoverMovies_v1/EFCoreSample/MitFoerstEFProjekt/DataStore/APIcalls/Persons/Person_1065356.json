{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Filmmaker, writer and film lecturer Eric Pauwels started his career with what he calls ‘cinéma mémoire’, or ethnographic documentary. He obtained his PHD in cinematography in Paris with a documentary on the ‘possessed’ in Indonesia. Afterwards, eager to step out of his role of being a spectator, Pauwels begins to make dance videos and works of fiction. The latter are so-called ‘half films’: half documentary, half fiction. But which distance does one keep to one’s subjects? Pauwels’ answer is clear: eliminate the distance and become a subject amongst your subjects. For him, cinema and life should ideally coincide; fiction should penetrate documentary.","birthday":"1953-11-02","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":1065356,"imdb_id":"nm1062779","known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eric Pauwels","place_of_birth":"Antwerp, Belgium","popularity":1.96,"profile_path":"/obh8eovMHOSkDMNyZkCVGEEPTHT.jpg"}
