{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Jean Pierre Marielle","J.P. Marielle"],"biography":"Jean-Pierre Marielle (born April 12, 1932) is a French actor. He has played in more than a hundred movies in which he brought life to a very large diversity of roles, from the banal citizen (Les Galettes de Pont-Aven), to the serial killer (Sans mobile apparent), to the World War II hero (Les Milles), to the compromised spy (La Valise), to the has-been actor (Les Grands Ducs), acting always with the same excellence whatever the quality of the movie in itself. He is well known for his outspokenness and especially for his warm and cavernous voice which is often imitated by French humorists considering him as the archetype of the French gentleman.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jean-Pierre Marielle, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1932-04-12","deathday":"2019-04-24","gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":20795,"imdb_id":"nm0547339","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jean-Pierre Marielle","place_of_birth":"Dijon, CÃ´te-d'Or, France","popularity":6.31,"profile_path":"/l56lXHVUUO2bMeTjEaB0tzYuW8.jpg"}
