He worked as European war correspondent during World War I. He was the editor of Outlook magazine and a correspondent for the New York World.\n\nIn 1927, he was retained by Horace Liveright to revise Hamilton Deane's stage adaptation of Dracula for its American production.

He spent much of his career adapting novels for the screen, including The Prisoner of Zenda in 1937 and 1944's Gaslight, which earned him his second Academy Award nomination (the first was for 1935's The Lives of a Bengal Lancer).
