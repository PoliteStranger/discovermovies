His rave film Groove (2000) (starring Hamish Linklater) was an Independent Spirit Award nominee; and the thriller A Bit of Bad Luck (2014) (starring Cary Elwes), was awarded \"Best Cinematography\" by the Los Angeles Movie Awards. Five of his features have premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, including the gritty spaghetti western Outlaws and Angels (2016), which was included in Variety's \"21 Best Films of Sundance 2016\".\n\nIrving grew up in the tiny town of Mountain Lakes, New Jersey, where he began shooting Super-8mm movies with his brother at the age of nine. He migrated west and earned his undergraduate degree at Stanford University, and an MFA from the University of Southern California's School of Cinema/Television. After his first feature \"One\" garnered wide-spread critical acclaim, Irving was named one of the \"25 New Faces of Independent Film\" by Filmmaker Magazine. Since then, he has repeatedly earned accolades for his style of \"precise framing and camera movement\" and his \"acute attention to color, lighting, and texture\". In 2005, Irving married the love of his life, director/producer/actress Cindy Baer at the little chapel in Yosemite National Park.","birthday":"1971-02-18","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":"http://www.matthewirving.com/","id":37004,"imdb_id":"nm0004089","known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Matthew Irving","place_of_birth":"Mountain Lakes, New Jersey, USA","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}
