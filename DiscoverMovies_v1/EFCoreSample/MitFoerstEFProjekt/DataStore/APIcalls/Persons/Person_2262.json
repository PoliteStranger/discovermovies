{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"​From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nJohn Burgess Wilson (25 February 1917 – 22 November 1993) — who published under the pen name Anthony Burgess — was an English author, poet, playwright, composer, linguist, translator and critic. The dystopian satire A Clockwork Orange is Burgess' most famous novel, though he dismissed it as one of his lesser works. It was adapted into a highly controversial 1971 film by Stanley Kubrick; which Burgess said was chiefly responsible for the popularity of the book. Burgess produced numerous other novels, including the Enderby quartet, and Earthly Powers. He was a prominent critic, writing acclaimed studies of classic writers such as William Shakespeare, James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence and Ernest Hemingway. In 2008, The Times placed Burgess number 17 on their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". Burgess was an accomplished musician and linguist. He composed over 250 musical works, including a first symphony around age 18, wrote a number of libretti, and translated, among other works, Cyrano de Bergerac, Oedipus the King and Carmen.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Anthony Burgess, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1917-02-25","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":2262,"imdb_id":"nm0121256","known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anthony Burgess","place_of_birth":"Manchester, England, UK","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/q2TwZN6W93PzKapVDhde9Lo1kxn.jpg"}
