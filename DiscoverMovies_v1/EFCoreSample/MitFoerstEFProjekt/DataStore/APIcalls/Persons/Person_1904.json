{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Michael Anthony Hall (born April 14, 1968), known professionally as Anthony Michael Hall, is an American actor, producer and director who starred in several teen-oriented films of the 1980s. Hall began his career in commercials and on stage as a child, and made his screen debut in 1980. His films with director-screenwriter John Hughes, beginning with the popular 1984 coming-of-age comedy Sixteen Candles, shaped his early career. Hall's next movies with Hughes were the teen classics The Breakfast Club and Weird Science, both in 1985. His performances as lovable geeks in these three films connected his name and face with the stereotype for an entire generation.\n\nHall diversified his roles to avoid becoming typecast as his geek persona, joining the cast of Saturday Night Live (1985â€“1986) and starring in films such as Out Of Bounds (1986), Johnny Be Good (1988), Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Six Degrees of Separation (1993). After a series of minor roles in the 1990s, his performance as Microsoft's Bill Gates in the 1999 film Pirates of Silicon Valley put him back in the spotlight. He had the starring role in the USA Network series The Dead Zone, from 2002 to 2007. During its run, the show was one of the highest-rated cable television series.\n\n-From Wikipidea","birthday":"1968-04-14","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":"http://www.anthonymichaelhall.net","id":1904,"imdb_id":"nm0001309","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Michael Hall","place_of_birth":"Boston, Massachusetts, USA","popularity":10.79,"profile_path":"/nLthzoCuNxxd3KteIrnnMg1066G.jpg"}
