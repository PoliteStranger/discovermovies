{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["David Daniel Kaminsky"],"biography":"Danny Kaye (born David Daniel Kaminsky; January 18, 1911 – March 3, 1987) was a celebrated American actor, singer, dancer, and comedian. His best known performances featured physical comedy, idiosyncratic pantomimes, and rapid-fire nonsense songs.\n\nKaye starred in 17 movies, notably The Kid from Brooklyn (1946), The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947), The Inspector General (1949), Hans Christian Andersen (1952), and — perhaps his most accomplished performance — The Court Jester (1956). His films were extremely popular, especially his bravura performances of patter songs and children's favorites such as The Inch Worm and The Ugly Duckling. He was the first ambassador-at-large of UNICEF and received the French Legion of Honor in 1986 for his many years of work with the organization.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Danny Kaye, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1911-01-18","deathday":"1987-03-03","gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":70668,"imdb_id":"nm0001414","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny Kaye","place_of_birth":"Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA","popularity":5.24,"profile_path":"/uHe4AuRJRWbCcCaURE33FnA6X2Q.jpg"}
