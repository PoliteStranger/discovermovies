He has received three Academy Awards: Best Adapted Screenplay for Midnight Express (1978), and Best Director for Platoon (1986) and Born on the Fourth of July (1989). The British newspaper The Guardian described him as \"one of the few committed men of the left working in mainstream American cinema.\"\n\nStone's movies often use many different cameras and film formats, including VHS, 8 mm film, and 70 mm film.
