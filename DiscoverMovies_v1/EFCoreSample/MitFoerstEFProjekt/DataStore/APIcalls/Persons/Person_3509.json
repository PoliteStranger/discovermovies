The mild-mannered Daniel Ceccaldi is famous as Claude Jade's father Lucien Darbon in François Truffaut's movies Stolen Kisses and Bed & Board.Note: Christine refers to him twice as \"Lucien\", not papa, indicating perhaps that he is not her biological father, echoing Truffaut's own experience. The American critics Bob Wade wrote about Ceccaldi in 'Stolen Kisses': \"Claude Jade's parents are memorably played by Daniel Ceccaldi and Claire Duhamel. Ceccaldi’s role may represent the most pleasant and neurosis-free father in any movie of the era. He overflows with Dickensian warmth and geniality.\"\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Daniel Ceccaldi, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1927-07-25","deathday":"2003-03-27","gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":3509,"imdb_id":"nm0147561","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Ceccaldi","place_of_birth":"Meaux, Seine-et-Marne, France","popularity":2.528,"profile_path":"/v6liZfpyauz8KhFx0LFw3rRWKVh.jpg"}
