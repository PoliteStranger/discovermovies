{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Gin"],"biography":"Gin Clarke was first spotted by French designer Jean-Paul Gaultier whilst on a trip in London. Soon her tall athletic figure and beautifully shaped bald head were gracing catwalks all over Europe. Her look was copied by a number of young, black models, especially in the UK where many bald black women modeled for UK shows in the mid-90s.\n\nShe no longer does catwalk modelling, but has appeared in the movies Le cinquième élément\n\n (1997), the latest Star War films and several music videos. Her clean-shaven head has been a permanent feature and become the most important part of her look.  - IMDb Mini Biography","birthday":null,"deathday":null,"gender":0,"homepage":null,"id":1427818,"imdb_id":"nm0164778","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gin Clarke","place_of_birth":null,"popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null}
