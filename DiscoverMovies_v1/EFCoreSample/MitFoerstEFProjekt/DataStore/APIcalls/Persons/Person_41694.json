On April 3rd, 2013 announced his cancer had returned and he would be taking a \"leave of presence\", lowering the amount he would be writing and only reviewing films he wanted to review.  \n\nEbert succumbed to his cancer the next day, April 4th, 2013. \n\nThe balcony is closed. ","birthday":"1942-06-18","deathday":"2013-04-04","gender":2,"homepage":"https://www.rogerebert.com/","id":41694,"imdb_id":"nm0001170","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Ebert","place_of_birth":"Urbana, Illinois, USA","popularity":1.285,"profile_path":"/rlkm96hz063CBGtG7pHKllLg8ZV.jpg"}
