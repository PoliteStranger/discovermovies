While he was still at a very young age, his family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father was a professor. While still in high school, he enrolled in the university's film animation class and began making short films. After graduating high school, he went to Hollywood, where he worked as a freelance editor. His first major break was in 1986 when the rock group Yes assigned him to shoot a full-length concert film for the band. Following this achievement, he filmed Winston (1987), the short-subject film that he would later expand into Sex, Lies, and Videotape (1989). Over the next six years, he was married to actress Betsy Brantley and had a daughter named Sarah.","birthday":"1963-01-14","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":1884,"imdb_id":"nm0001752","known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Soderbergh","place_of_birth":"Atlanta, Georgia, USA","popularity":6.436,"profile_path":"/y8JlSDcQzd7gAaKyxFpExupMwDz.jpg"}
