Boogie"],"biography":"Lauryn Hill, a native of South Orange, New Jersey, first came to attention with the multi-talented The Fugees. Their first album, \"Blunted On Reality\", went virtually unnoticed by the public; their real breakthrough came with the sophomore album, \"The Score\", which featured \"Killing Me Softly\". That album stills remains the worldwide top-selling rap album of all time (17 million units shipped). She earned two Grammys (Best Rap Album and Best R&B Performance by a duo or group) in 1996 and gave birth to Zion (alleged father is Bob Marley's son) before releasing her self-written and self-produced solo album, \"The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill\", which topped Billboard charts the moment it came out.
