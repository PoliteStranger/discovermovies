{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Black Sabbath "],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nJohn Michael \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English singer-songwriter and occasional actor, whose career has spanned over 40 years. As of December 2010, Osbourne has sold over 100 million albums worldwide.\n\nOsbourne rose to prominence as lead vocalist of the pioneering English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, a band whose radically different, intentionally dark, doom sound spawned the heavy metal genre. In his subsequent solo career Osbourne achieved a multi-platinum status in addition to the one he had earned with Black Sabbath. These things are what led Osbourne to become known as the \"Godfather of Heavy Metal\". It was during his Sabbath days that, due to their dark style of music, Osbourne became known as the \"Prince of Darkness\". Osbourne has over 15 tattoos, the most famous of which are the letters O-Z-Z-Y across the knuckles of his left hand. This was his first tattoo, created by himself as a teenager with a sewing needle and pencil lead.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Osbourne's career expanded to a new medium when he became a star in his own reality show, The Osbournes, alongside wife/manager Sharon and two of their three children, Kelly and Jack.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Ozzy Osbourne, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia","birthday":"1948-12-03","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":12208,"imdb_id":"nm0005285","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ozzy Osbourne","place_of_birth":"Aston, Birmingham, England, UK","popularity":7.901,"profile_path":"/wu5vrd2dQzXaxqZw2LOeFlhjSkT.jpg"}
