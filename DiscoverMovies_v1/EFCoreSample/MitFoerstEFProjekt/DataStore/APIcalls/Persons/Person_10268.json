Besides being one of France's most popular and enduring singers, he is also one of the best-known singers in the world. Charles Aznavour (pronounced in French as Sharl Aznavour) is known for his characteristic short figure and unique tenor voice; clear and ringing in its upper reaches, with gravelly and profound low notes. He has appeared in more than 60 movies, composed about 1,000 songs (including 150 at least in English, 100 in Italian, 70 in Spanish, and 50 in German), and has sold well over 100 million records.\n\nIn 1998, Charles Aznavour was named Entertainer of the Century by CNN and users of Time Online from around the globe. He was recognized as the century's outstanding performer, with nearly 18% of the total vote, edging out Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. He has sung for presidents, popes, and royalty, as well as at humanitarian events, and is the founder of the charitable organization Aznavour for Armenia along with his long-time friend and impresario Levon Sayan.\n\nAznavour started his global farewell tour in late 2006, which continues through this day. In 2009 he was appointed ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland, as well as Armenia's permanent delegate to the United Nations at Geneva.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Charles Aznavour, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1924-05-22","deathday":"2018-10-01","gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":10268,"imdb_id":"nm0002198","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles Aznavour","place_of_birth":"Paris, France","popularity":3.741,"profile_path":"/zAWJHQT4hY0ELK6aaSXRoAgEJbT.jpg"}
