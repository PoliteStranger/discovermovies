Owens was equally proficient in straight or silly assignments and was frequently heard on television and radio as well as in commercials.\n\nHe was best known, aside from being the announcer on Laugh-In, for providing the voice of the titular superhero on Space Ghost and Blue Falcon in Dynomutt, Dog Wonder. He also played himself in a cameo appearance on Space Ghost Coast to Coast in 1998. Owens' first cartoon-voice acting was performing the voice of Roger Ramjet on the Roger Ramjet cartoons.
