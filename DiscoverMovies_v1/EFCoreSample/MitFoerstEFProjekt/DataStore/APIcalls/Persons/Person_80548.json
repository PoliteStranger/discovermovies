{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nSteven Schachter is an American television, theatre, and film director and screenwriter.\n\nMuch of Schachter's success stems from projects on which he has collaborated with William H. Macy. The two co-wrote the cable television movies The Con (1998), A Slight Case of Murder (1999), Door to Door (2002), and The Wool Cap (2004), all of which Schachter directed and in which Macy starred. He also has directed numerous other made-for-TV movies, including an adaptation of David Mamet's play The Water Engine, which he had directed at the off-Broadway Public Theater in 1977 and again at the Plymouth Theatre on Broadway the following year. In 2006 he directed the TV movie The Mermaid Chair.\n\nSchachter's latest projects also involve Macy. In May 2007, he completed filming the feature The Deal, written by and starring Macy, which is scheduled for release in 2008. The two are collaborating on Family Man, a pilot for a TNT series in which Macy would portray a model husband and father of three who unbeknownst to his family leads a gang of burglars.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Steven Schachter, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia","birthday":null,"deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":80548,"imdb_id":"nm0769522","known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steven Schachter","place_of_birth":null,"popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}
