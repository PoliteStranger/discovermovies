{"adult":true,"also_known_as":["Chuck Peyton"],"biography":"One of the biggest names in porn, Jeff Stryker was a famously gay for pay performer. Not that anyone minded when they come face to face with his monster allegedly 10-inch cock. He went into production as well as starring in movies and, not surprisingly, was a top. Born in 1962 in Illinois, he debuted in the mid-1980s and was still making gay movies in 2001 - he's also made straight and bisexual films. In 2004, his image graced a postage stamp in the Netherlands while he was featured in a 1991 portrait by artists Pierre et Gilles. Jeff, who has a son, has been inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame for his work in adult films and in 2006 appeared in a one-man comedy theater show, A Sophisticated Evening with Jeff Stryker. It wasn't his first stage appearance - in 1998-99 he appeared in Jeff Stryker Does Hard Time, an erotic comedy set in a prison.","birthday":"1962-08-21","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":44942,"imdb_id":"nm0835436","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Stryker","place_of_birth":"Carmi, Illinois, USA","popularity":6.847,"profile_path":"/xLr2oHzyyi8ZM83miLslvNBkE7w.jpg"}
