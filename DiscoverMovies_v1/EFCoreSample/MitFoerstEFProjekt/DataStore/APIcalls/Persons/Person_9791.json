{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Ringgold Wilmer Lardner Jr."],"biography":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nRinggold Wilmer \"Ring\" Lardner Jr. (August 19, 1915 â€“ October 31, 2000) was an American journalist and screenwriter blacklisted by the Hollywood movie studios during the Red Scare of the late 1940s and 1950s.\n\nRing Lardner Jr. moved to Hollywood where he worked as a publicist and \"script doctor\" before writing his own material. This included Woman of the Year, a film that won him an Academy Award for Writing Original Screenplay in 1942. He also worked on the scripts for the films Laura (1944), Brotherhood of Man (1946), Forever Amber (1947), and M*A*S*H (1970). The script of the latter earned him an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nLardner held strong left-wing views and during the Spanish Civil War he helped raise funds for the Republican cause. He was also involved in organizing anti-fascist demonstrations. His brother, James Lardner, was a member of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, and was killed in action in Spain in 1938. Although his political involvement upset the owners of the film studios, he continued to be given work and in 1947 became one of the highest paid scriptwriters in Hollywood when he signed a contract with 20th Century Fox at $2,000 a week.","birthday":"1915-08-19","deathday":"2000-10-31","gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":9791,"imdb_id":"nm0488057","known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ring Lardner, Jr.","place_of_birth":"Chicago, Illinois, U.S.","popularity":0.631,"profile_path":null}
