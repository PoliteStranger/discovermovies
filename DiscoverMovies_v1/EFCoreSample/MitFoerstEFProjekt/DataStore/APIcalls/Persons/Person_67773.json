His ascent to fame picked up when he became a writer for the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, and later became a frequent guest on The Tonight Show. In the 1970s, Martin performed his offbeat, absurdist comedy routines before packed houses on national tours. Since the 1980s, having branched away from stand-up comedy, he has become a successful actor, playwright, pianist, banjo player, and juggler, eventually earning Emmy, Grammy, and American Comedy awards.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Steve Martin, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1945-08-14","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":"http://www.stevemartin.com","id":67773,"imdb_id":"nm0000188","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Martin","place_of_birth":"Waco, Texas, USA","popularity":8.939,"profile_path":"/d0KthX8hVWU9BxTCG1QUO8FURRm.jpg"}
