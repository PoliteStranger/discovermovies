{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["The Real Kid Capri","David Anthony Love, Jr."],"biography":"Born David Anthony Love in Bronx, New York, Kid Capri was born creatively ambitious, scaling his family's old Zenith stereo system as an attempt to scratch records before he was even ten years old. Kid first inched his way onto the Hip-Hop scene with the grass-roots approach of club gigs and creating mixtapes. Kid is, in fact, the Prime Minister of mixtapes, as he saw their profit potential early in his career. He managed to turn a small business venture into a $2,000 a night, underground empire! Once others caught on to the economic benefits of mixtapes, they soon followed in Kids footsteps and thus began the Kid Capri bandwagon.","birthday":"1967-02-07","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":"http://www.kidcapri.com/site/","id":1221706,"imdb_id":"nm0452205","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kid Capri","place_of_birth":"The Bronx, New York USA","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}
