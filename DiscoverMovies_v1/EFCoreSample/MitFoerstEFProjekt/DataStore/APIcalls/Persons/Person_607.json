He is counted amongst the Fifth Generation of Chinese filmmakers, having made his directorial debut in 1987 with Red Sorghum. Zhang has won numerous awards and recognitions, with Best Foreign Film nominations for Ju Dou in 1990 and Raise the Red Lantern in 1991, Silver Lion and Golden Lion prizes at the Venice Film Festival, Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. One of Zhang's recurrent themes is the resilience of Chinese people in the face of hardship and adversity, a theme which has been explored in such films as, for example, To Live (1994) and Not One Less (1999). His films are particularly noted for their rich use of colour, as can be seen in some of his early films, like Raise the Red Lantern, and in his wuxia films like Hero and House of Flying Daggers.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Zhang Yimou, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.    ","birthday":"1951-11-14","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":607,"imdb_id":"nm0955443","known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Zhang Yimou","place_of_birth":"中国, 陕西, 西安","popularity":4.961,"profile_path":"/n2EaUoFrhyGaFezgtJN9LEeitQe.jpg"}
