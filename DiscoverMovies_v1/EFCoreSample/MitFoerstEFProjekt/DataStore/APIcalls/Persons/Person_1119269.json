His innovations include using tape loops to create phasing patterns (for example, his early compositions It's Gonna Rain and Come Out), and the use of simple, audible processes to explore musical concepts (for instance, Pendulum Music and Four Organs). These compositions, marked by their use of repetitive figures, slow harmonic rhythm and canons, have significantly influenced contemporary music, especially in the US. Reich's work took on a darker character in the 1980s with the introduction of historical themes as well as themes from his Jewish heritage, notably Different Trains.\n\nWriting in The Guardian, music critic Andrew Clements suggested that Reich is one of \"a handful of living composers who can legitimately claim to have altered the direction of musical history\".[6] The American composer and critic Kyle Gann has said that Reich \"may ... be considered, by general acclamation, America's greatest living composer\".\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia","birthday":"1936-10-03","deathday":null,"gender":2,"homepage":"http://www.stevereich.com/","id":1119269,"imdb_id":"nm0716962","known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Steve Reich","place_of_birth":"New York City, New York, USA","popularity":0.764,"profile_path":"/u7Wyc8ekzzW6qDD77oHLREVBOqx.jpg"}
