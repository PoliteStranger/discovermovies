He began his career in the mid 1950s as a classical baritone, singing with orchestras and opera companies throughout the United States. His career reoriented away from classical music to musical theatre in 1960 after Meredith Willson cast him in the lead role of his new Broadway musical The Unsinkable Molly Brown. His portrayal of \"Leadville Johnny\" was a resounding success and he reprised the role in the 1964 film version of the musical, winning a Golden Globe Award for his portrayal.\n\nPresnell went on to star in a few more films during the 1960s, but by the early 1970s that aspect of his career came to a standstill.
