Out of all the voice actors of Barney, West's voice is the most well-known.\n\nAs Barney, West's voice was used on the television series, in a 70 market radio show, on Multi-Platinum and Multi-Gold albums, for a feature film, for CBS and NBC primetime specials, for touring performances, as a Daytime Emmy presenter, for toys, for educational games, and for \"personal appearances\".
